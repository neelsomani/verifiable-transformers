# Verifiable Transformers

We design a Transformer variant whose entire forward pass can be encoded exactly in an SMT solver, so the solver can reason about the model’s behavior over all inputs in a bounded domain. Once the full model is SMT-representable, we formally check properties like:

* whether the model is exactly equivalent to a given symbolic program on all sequences of length ≤ n,
* whether particular connections are necessary for the model’s behavior (circuit minimality)
* whether the model obeys structural constraints (like local attention), and
* impossibility results on circuits (e.g., counts above k collapse to the same internal state)

The core idea is to make the whole Transformer verifiable so these properties can be proven or refuted over the entire input domain, not just tested on examples.

There are two parts of the Transformer architecture that are traditionally difficult to SMT encode. First, the attention mechanism. Starting from the Deep Sets characterization of permutation-invariant functions, we re-derive the structural form of attention and show that it naturally decomposes into three learnable components: an aggregator ρ, a relevance scoring function u, and a content map v. We then characterize the verifiable subset of this space: all attention mechanisms whose computation can be expressed using only affine maps, piecewise-linear transformations, thresholding, and Top-k style selection - primitives that admit exact SMT encodings. Second, we apply a similar approach to the LayerNorm.

We show, end-to-end, that a Transformer can be trained and then formally analyzed at the circuit level: we extract the learned addition mechanism, prove bounded correctness, prove structural properties of the circuit, and prove impossibility/generalization limits. This work suggests a new direction for interpretable and certifiable sequence modeling.
